# SNZ_Land_use_replica_example
A replication of the Statistics NZ horticultural land use. This is designed to serve as an example of how to build a similar shiny app. It uses simulated data to populate the dataset and uses seasons rather than years. This was built as a tool to help guide the Economic Farm Dashboard been built by DairyNZ.

# Instructions

This is a replication of the Statistics NZ agricultural land use Shiny app. The purpose of it is to replicate some of the features so that these features can then be utilised in other Shiny apps. The SNZ agricultural land use Shiny app is an excellent example of the power of a Shiny app without requiring extremely complex features. The app uses a mixture of reactive calls, server-side rendering and conditional tab panels to replicate the app.

The original app can be found here: https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/agricultural-and-horticultural-land-use
